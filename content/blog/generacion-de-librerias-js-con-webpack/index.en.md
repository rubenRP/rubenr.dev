We live in a time when Javascript dominates the web and the architecture based on microservices is taken as a standard. React, Vue and Angular have a dominant and growing position in the scene, however there is a large percentage of front development that is done the "old way" and it is necessary to encapsulate functionalities in a library so that they can be imported into an HTML.

A typical example is the import of a third-party widget, library or service into an existing website. The simplest and most basic option is to create a .js file and develop there, exposing the content using [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) if necessary. This would be a somewhat limited approach for libraries with complex functionality. Currently there are tools that allow the generation of libraries while developing in a modern _stack_ js. This is the case of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), a tool used by almost everyone, and especially in React but very unknown since it works "behind the curtain".

In this article we are going to create a development _boilerplate_ that generates a simple widget using Webpack. Before continuing, let's add a bit of context about what Webpack is and what requirements we need to cover.

## What is Webpack?

</div>

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) is a library that allows us to manage resources to do multiple tasks: from packaging code to putting it into production, compiling files [SASS](https: // sass- lang.com) or [LESS](http://lesscss.org), the generation of a development server with hot reloading, or the creation of a bundle, minification among others. For this, it uses rules in which once the file or code pattern has been recognized, make the pertinent modifications. This is done through loaders. There are loaders to compile SASS code, to minify html, to run [Babel](https://babeljs.io), etc ...

One of the problems of Webpack that can do so many things that it is a bit overwhelming, and it is true: it can do many things, but for this case we are going to simplify and we are going to generate a script that:

- Generate a JS library that can be imported into HTML files and invoked from it
- Compile SCSS files
- Use ES6
- Contain ESlint and Prettier
- Be isolated from the hypothetical development in which it is imported

With these conditions set we are ready to start developing the _boilerplate_.

## Creation of the application

Once the project is created with _npm init_ we install Webpack and its dependencies:

```bash
npm install webpack@4 webpack-cli@3 webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin mini-css-extract-plugin html-loader sass-loader babel-loader css-loader node-sass --save-dev
```

> Version 4 of Webpack has been installed, due to an incompatibility with the SASS loader and as it is not the subject of this article, not much time has been invested in investigating it.

After this we install the Babel, Prettier plugins and their respective plugins:

```bash
npm install babel babel-eslint eslint-config-airbnb eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y @babel/preset-env @babel/plugin-transform-runtime @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import prettier --save-dev
```

## ESLint and Babel configuration

Since we have imported the AirBnb configurations to develop with its style rules, it is necessary to import them into ESLint through the file [.eslintrc.js](https://github.com/rubenRP/js-widget-boilerplate/blob/master/.eslintrc.js)

```jsx
module.exports = {
  parser: "babel-eslint",
  extends: ["airbnb", "prettier"],
  plugins: ["react", "jsx-a11y", "import"],
  env: {
    browser: true,
  },
}
```

We do the same with the Babel configuration file [babel.config.js](https://github.com/rubenRP/js-widget-boilerplate/blob/master/babel.config.js):

```jsx
module.exports = {
  presets: ["@babel/preset-env"],
  plugins: [
    "@babel/plugin-transform-runtime",
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread",
    "@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import",
  ],
}
```

## Webpack configuration

All Webpack action occurs in the file **[webpack.config.js](https://github.com/rubenRP/js-widget-boilerplate/blob/master/webpack.config.js)**. In this file, both the origin and destination of the data and the transformations that must be applied are set. Let's go through the file step by step:

```jsx
const webpack = require("webpack");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require("mini-css-extract-plugin");

const SRC_DIR = `${__dirname}/src`;
const DIST_DIR = `${__dirname}/dist`;

const libraryName = "test-widget";

module.exports = {
  entry: [`${SRC_DIR}/index.js`],
  output: {
    path: DIST_DIR,
    publicPath: "",
    filename: `${libraryName}.js`
  },
```

In the initial part of the file we define the data source and the destination. We intend that the library is generated from the _index.js_ file that is in the _/src_ folder and is housed in the _/dist._ folder. In turn, we define the name of the resulting file, which in this case will be _/dist/test-widget.js._

```jsx
module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader"
        }
      },
      {
        test: /\.(scss|sass|css)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loaders: [
          MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
          {
            loader: "css-loader",
            options: {
              modules: true,
              sourceMap: true,
              importLoaders: 1,
              localIdentName: "[local]"
            }
          },
          "sass-loader"
        ]
      },
      {
        test: /\.(html)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "html-loader",
          options: { minimize: false }
        }
      }
    ]
  },
```

Once the routes are defined, the generation rules are managed. in our case there are 3:

- Use the Babel loader for .js or .jsx files
- For sass, scss and css files use the CSS loader to generate the [SourceMap](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) and in turn pass the SASS loader
- For html files use the html loader and avoid minifying the content.

All loaders are documented on the [Webpack page](https://v4.webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/) with information about their operation and their configuration options.

```jsx
resolve: {
    extensions: ["*", ".js", ".jsx"]
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: `${SRC_DIR}/index.html`,
      filename: "./index.html"
    }),
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: "[name].css",
      chunkFilename: "[id].css"
    })
  ],
  devServer: {
    contentBase: DIST_DIR,
    hot: true,
    port: 3000
  }
```

Finally, both the plugins for the _hot reloading_ and the information related to the development server are added.

With all this information we are ready to add the tasks in the _package.json_ file and start development.

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "webpack -p --mode production",
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --config ./webpack.config.js --mode development",
    "test": "jest --env=jsdom"
  },
```

## Widget development

To test the operation we are going to create a simple file [index.js](https://github.com/rubenRP/js-widget-boilerplate/blob/master/src/index.js) that represents the entry point of the application and that takes as its source a div on which the content will be generated dynamically. To do this, we create an _init_ function, which will be called when embedding the widget:

```jsx
import Widget from "./components/widget"
import styles from "./styles/main.scss"
;(function (window) {
  console.log("Widget initialized!")
  const _init = (params) => {
    Widget.generate(params, model)
  }
  window.Widget = {
    init: _init,
  }
})(window)
```

This file calls the component [widget.js](https://github.com/rubenRP/js-widget-boilerplate/blob/master/src/components/widget.js), which is responsible for taking the one parameter that serves from _container_ and add the relevant content there:

```jsx
const Widget = {}

/**
 *
 *
 * @param {*} { container = "" }
 * @param {*} [model={}]
 */
Widget.generate = ({ container = "" }) => {
  const widgetInner = document.createElement("div")
  let widgetContainer = document.getElementById(container)

  widgetInner.setAttribute("class", "module-inner")
  widgetInner.innerHTML = "<h1>Widget created</h1>"

  if (!widgetContainer) {
    ;[widgetContainer] = document.getElementsByTagName("body")
  }

  widgetContainer.appendChild(widgetInner)
}

export default Widget
```

With this, and once the npm run build command is called, we can create an html file by calling the library:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Test Widget</title>
    <script src="test-widget.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="widget-container"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      Widget.init({
        container: "widget-container",
      })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

That's all. You can see the final result of this little _boilerplate_ in [this Github repository](https://github.com/rubenRP/js-widget-boilerplate).
